Whoever wants to complete tasks requiring high-performance computing can upload them, then the CONUN Drive stores them. However, more than simple storage, the CONUN Drive aims to become a market where you can share and purchase digital assets. A cryptocurrency wallet, METACON, processes any transactions for rewards and payments in any CONUN's services like the DSC platform.
